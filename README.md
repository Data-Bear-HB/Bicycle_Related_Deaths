## Introduction
Many people in the United States regularly commute by bicycle. In a collision between a car and cyclist, the cyclist, having no seatbelt, airbag, or external structure, is much more vulnerable to injury or death. Of course, there are other, non-car-related ways to die on a bicycle. Recently, there has been a rise of bicycle-related-deaths in the United States.  This analysis looks at this rising rate and compares Oregon, Washington, and national rates.
