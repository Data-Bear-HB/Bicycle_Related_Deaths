## Introduction
Many people in the United States regularly commute by bicycle. In a collision between a car and cyclist, the cyclist, having no seatbelt, airbag, or external structure, is much more vulnerable to injury or death. This analysis looks at the rising rate of bicyclist deaths and considers Oregon and Washington rates.
